# AWS Regions

# How to Choose an AWS Region

- `Compliance` with data governance and legal requirements: data never leaves a region without your explicit permission
- `Proximity` to customers: reduced latency
- `Available services` within a region: new services and new features aren't available in every region
- `Pricing` varies region to region

# AWS Availability Zones
- Each region has many availability zones (usually 3, min is 2, max is 6), example:
    - ap-southeast-2a
    - ap-southeast-2b
- Each availability zones (AZ) is one or more discrete data centers with redundant power, networking, and connectivity
- Separated from each other, so that they're isolate from disasters
- Connected with high bandwidth, ultra-low latency networking

- these zones form a region
