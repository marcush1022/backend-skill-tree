# **Distributed systems components**
This chapter focus on cross-service challenges, such as **service discovery, data consistency, asynchronous communication, and distributed monitoring and auditing**.

## **Service Discovery**
One of the primary challenges with microservice architectures is enabling services to **discover and interact with each other**. 

The distributed characteristics of microservice architectures not only make it harder for **services to communicate**, but also presents other challenges, such as **checking the health of those systems** and **announcing when new applications become available**.

You also must decide how and where to **store meta information, such as configuration data**.

### **DNS-based Service Discovery**
`Amazon ECS` now includes integrated service discovery that **enables your containerized services to discover and connect with each other**.

Previously, to ensure that services were able to **discover and connect with each other**, you had to configure and run your own service discovery system based on `Amazon Route 53`, `AWS Lambda`, and ECS event streams, or connect every service to a load balancer.

`Amazon ECS` creates and manages a registry of service names using the `Route 53 Auto Naming API`. **Names are automatically mapped to a set of DNS records** so that you can **refer to a service by name in your code and write DNS queries to have the name resolve to the service’s endpoint** at runtime. 

You can **specify health check conditions** in a service's task definition and `Amazon ECS` ensures that only healthy service endpoints are returned by a service lookup.

Another option is to use the capabilities of `AWS Cloud Map`. AWS Cloud Map extends the capabilities of the Auto Naming APIs by **providing a service registry for resources**, such as **Internet Protocols (IPs), Uniform Resource Locators (URLs), and Amazon Resource Names (ARNs)**, and offering an **API-based service discovery mechanism** with a faster change propagation and the ability to use attributes to narrow down the set of
discovered resources. Existing Route 53 Auto Naming resources are upgraded automatically to AWS Cloud Map.

### **Service Meshes**
In an advanced microservices architecture, **the actual application can be composed of hundreds, or even thousands, of services**. Often the most complex part of the application is not the actual services themselves, but the **communication between those services**. Service meshes are an additional layer for **handling interservice communication**, which is responsible for **monitoring and controlling traffic in microservices architectures**. This enables tasks, like service discovery, to be completely handled by this layer.

Typically, a service mesh is split into **a data plane and a control plane**. The data plane consists of a set of **intelligent proxies that are deployed with the application code as a special sidecar proxy that intercepts all network communication between microservices**. The control plane is responsible for **communicating with the proxies**.

Service meshes are transparent, which means that application developers don’t have to be aware of this additional layer and don’t have to make changes to existing application code. `AWS App Mesh` is a service mesh that **provides application-level networking to enable your services to communicate with each other across multiple types of compute infrastructure**. App Mesh standardizes how your **services communicate**, giving you
complete visibility and ensuring high availability for your applications.

You can use App Mesh with existing or new microservices running on `Amazon EC2`, `Fargate`, `Amazon ECS`, `Amazon EKS`, and self-managed Kubernetes on AWS.
